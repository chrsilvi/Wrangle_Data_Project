This is a project I completed while doing the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

The project focuses on wrangling and analyzing data, and the sample data set
is the twitter history of @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.

The project required identifying 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues within the data and correcting those, and then brief reports on wrangling the data and analyzing it.
